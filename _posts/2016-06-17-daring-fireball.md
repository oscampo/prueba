John thanking Makerbase.
> My thanks to Makerbase for sponsoring last week’s DF RSS feed. Makerbase is like an IMDB for people who make apps, websites, and podcasts. New features include the ability to get notified — optionally! — when your friends make a new project, or when someone says you inspire them.
